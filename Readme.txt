Chromium Driver:
Selenium webdrivers naming convention have changed. The Chrome driver to use shall match the Browser version.
I ran the test using the latest version of Chrome (79). As such, I have installed chormium driver version 79. If you need to test with a different version of Chrome, please download the chromium driver here.
Or you can just upgrade to the latest Chrome 79.

Selenium Webdriver:
I found the stable version is from year 2017, version 3.5.1 . Please download this version. Also download Selenium Support 3.5.1

Logging:
This uses the package SeleniumLog from NuGet. It is an Open Source logging I developed some years ago for Selenium Webdriver.
